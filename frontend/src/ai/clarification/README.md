## 📌 Purpose & Overview
Logic managing blocking vs non-blocking clarification prompt display and user answer submissions.

## 🏗️ Architectural Role

## 🔒 Security & Quality Invariants
- All state-changing operations are audited and validated.
- Strict typing and Pydantic/JSON Schema contracts are enforced.
- No direct LLM access to authoritative database writes or final coordinate math.
