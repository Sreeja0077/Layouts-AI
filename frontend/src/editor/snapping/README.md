Real-time snapping assistance to nearby walls, adjacent furniture edges, and grid coordinates.

## 🏗️ Architectural Role
- **Domain Layer:** `frontend/src/editor/snapping`
- **System Authority:** Deterministic Python owns geometry & state; AI proposes intent; PostGIS stores authoritative truth.

## 📁 Related Subdirectories & Responsibilities
This directory contains modular components structured according to the *AI-Assisted Office Layout Generation Platform Deep Architecture Blueprint*.

## 🔒 Security & Quality Invariants
- All state-changing operations are audited and validated.
- Strict typing and Pydantic/JSON Schema contracts are enforced.
- No direct LLM access to authoritative database writes or final coordinate math.
